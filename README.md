Welcome to the Contact Management System

The instructions are pretty straight forward
1. Add Contact- will ask you the first name, last name, phone number and email of the contact. It will confirm when it has been added
2. View Contact- will show you a list of the current contacts in the system. The program will start with 0 contacts
3. Edit Contact- will allow you to select from the list of contacts by selecting the associated number and which attribute you wish to change and apply it
4. Delete Contact- will allow you to select from the list of contacts by selecting the associated number and will delete the one selected, showing you the new list of contacts after it has been deleted.
5. Search Contact- will allow you to search for any of the attributes you will to search and it will find the associated contact
6. Export Contact- will save your current contact list to an exported_contacts.txt file in the same directory
7. Import Contacts- will use a feature that will pop up a box and ask you to find a file to import from your computer. Here you will want to use the included 15_contacts.txt. Once selected, it will add them to the current contacts list. For testing purposes so you dont have to create a bunch of contacts, I would suggest doing this FIRST so you can just use those.
8. Exit Program- this will make a backup of the current contacts in your list and close the program.
